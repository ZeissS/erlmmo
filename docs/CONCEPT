Abstract:
---------
This describes the several components of my little mmo project as well what they do and how they interact.

Components:
-----------
 * Game-app: An erlang server where the user can connect and walk around in a virtual world. 
 * WWW: A bunch of php scripts to give the users an administration tool for their accounts.
 * DB: A Couchdb storing the data for the 3 app servers above.
 
 * couchdb-tools: Commandline tools for Import/Export of a CouchDB (nothing really game related)
 * Stomp-Smtp-Transport: Reads messages from a stomp queue and sends them out via smtp
 
Technologies so far: PHP, Erlang, CouchDB(REST), Python
