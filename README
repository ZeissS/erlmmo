Erlmmo
======

Erlmmo is a small testproject for me to get started with erlang and javafx.
The project is splitted into 2 subprojects:

* Client: The client is a bunch of javafx scripts for displaying the gamecontent.
* Server: Each Client connects here and all that stuff. What you would expect a server to do ;)
