Erlmmo
======

Erlmmo is a small testproject for me to get started with erlang.
Target is to have a small game, where people can connect and 
talk to each other and play some games. For details about the
components see docs/CONCEPT.

Plannings
---------
I'm for now planning to implement the game as one erlang application, started in one virtual machine.
If later needed, subprocesses are moved into separate processes.

Licence
-------
Everything in here is free to use.
